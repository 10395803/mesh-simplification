		Note that projection does not necessarily mean orthogonal
		projection but simply the point minimizing the distance point-element. 
		Both a static and non-static interfaces are provided.
		This is a template class where the template parameter is the shape 
		SHAPE of the elements. 
		The class inherits meshInfo<SHAPE, MeshType::DATA>. 
		
		At the moment, only the specialization for triangular grids
		implemented. Further specializations may be added in future.
