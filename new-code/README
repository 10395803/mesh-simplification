README file for the project "An iterative mesh simplification procedure 
for grids with distributed data".

The main output of the project is the meshsimplification library.
The C++ code for the library, as well as that one for the applications
and the tests, has been split among the following folders:
	include/	header files for the meshsimplification library
	src/		source files for the meshsimplification library
	main/		source files for the applications
	test/		source files for the tests
	spike/		extra code which may turn out to be useful in the future
	lib/		third-party libraries required by the code
	
To compile the library meshsimplification and compile and link the
applications and the tests, from the project root folder type:
	make [RELEASE=yes] [ENABLE_SELF_INTERSECTIONS=yes]
Square brackets delimit optional arguments for enabling compile-time
optimizations and grid self intersections, respectively.

The above command generates the following folders:
	 build/		object files for the library, the executables (build/main)
	 			and the tests (build/test)
	 bin/		binaries for the executables (bin/main) and the tests (bin/test)
Furthermore, the meshsimplification library is put in the lib/ folder.

Typing
	make clean
from the project root folder removed the folders build/ and bin/ as well as
the compiled library meshsimplification.

Finally, example grids can be found in the folder mesh/ while post_processing/
stores MATLAB datasets and scripts for postprocessing.
