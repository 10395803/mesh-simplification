Image registration of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of various brains
with a real-time-built template.
The procedure consists of two steps:
-	build a template (atlas) brain out of the MRI of the brain of 30 patients
-	register each subject with the previously constructed template.

Two registration techniques are tested and compared. 
They have been proposed in the following two works:

	"A unified approach to fast image registration and a new curvature based 
	registration technique".

The current folder is structured as follows:
	brain-data/             	stores the MRI scan for each patient
	curvature-matlab-data/ 		MATLAB datasets needed for [1]
	curvature-matlab-script/	MATLAB functions and scripts performing [1]
	doc/                    	various useful sources
	fair/                   	FAIR MATLAB software implementing [1]
	nifti-image-toolbox/		MATLAB toolbox for images in NiFTI format
	result/                 	results obtained using [1] and [2]
