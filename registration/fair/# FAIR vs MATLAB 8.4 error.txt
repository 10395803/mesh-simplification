Thanks for pointing out the incompatibility of the FAIR toolbox with MATLAB 8.4

I apologize for the delayed answer. I did install the newest MATLAB version and Xcode and I was able to reproduce the error as well as to localize its source:

The MATLAB command fig = figure returns a so-called handle to a figure.
In previous versions of MATLAB, this is a number (numerical) in the new version, this is replaced by a structured object with a corresponding field.

The fix is actually relatively easy: simply replace 
OLD: fig = figure* by
NEW: fig = figure*; if ~isnumeric(fig), fig = fig.number; end
Note that the fix also covers older MATLAB versions.

Your error message is caused by the sprint command as it intends to format the structure fig as an integer.

Just now, I run the complete code to make sure I spot all the occurrences (so fare I found 3 occasions). As soon as this terminates, I will either update the zip file, or simply provide updated versions of affected m-files.

Thanks, Jan
