README file for the project "An iterative edge collapsing-based 
mesh simplification procedure for grids with distributed data".

The main output of the project is the meshsimplification library.
The C++ code for the library, as well as that one for the applications
and the tests, is shared among the following folders:
	include/	header files for the meshsimplification library
	src/		source files for the meshsimplification library
	main/		source files for the applications
	test/		source files for the tests
	spike/		extra code which may turn out to be useful in the future
	lib/		third-party libraries required by the code
	
To compile the shared library meshsimplification and compile and link the
applications, from the project root folder type:
	make [CXX=g++] [RELEASE=yes] [ENABLE_SELF_INTERSECTIONS=yes]
Square brackets delimit optional arguments for setting the GNU compiler,
enabling compile-time optimizations and grid self intersections, respectively.
By default, the clang C++ compiler is used, the code is compiled in debug mode
and the self-intersections are forbidden, respectively.

The above command generates the following folders:
	build/		object files for the static (build/static) and shared
	      		(build/dynamic) version of meshsimplification library, 
	      		the executables (build/main) and the tests (build/test)
	bin/		binaries for the executables (bin/main) and the tests (bin/test)
Furthermore, the meshsimplification library is put in the lib/ folder.

On some machines, there may be problems with the run-time loading of the
shared library meshsimplification. If so, manually export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable by typing from terminal:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="absolute path to lib/ directory"

Other Makefile targets are:
	folders		create output folders
	static		build the static meshsimplification library
	dynamic		build the shared meshsimplification library
	test		compile and link tests executable
	main		compile and link applications
	doc 		create code documentation through Doxygen and store it in /doc
Note that the static version of meshsimplification library may be built,
but it will never got linked against any application.

Typing
	make clean
from the project root folder, the folders build/, bin/ and /doc 
and the compiled library meshsimplification get removed.

Example grids can be found in the folder mesh/ while post_processing/
stores MATLAB datasets and scripts for postprocessing. 
Finally, some results obtained using the aforementioned library are in results/.
