Joined project for Numerical Analysis for Partial Differential equations (NAPDE) 
and Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing (APSC) courses @ Politecnico of Milan.

The aim of the project is two-folded:
-	providing a C++ implementation of an iterattive, edge collapsing-based mesh 
	simplification strategy for three-dimensional surface grids with distributed data
-	testing and comparing different image registration techniques for registering 
	a set of brain MRIs with a given template.

This repository comes with two main folders - simplification/ and registration/ - 
addressing the aforementioned tasks, respectively. 
Further details on the content of each folder can be found in the README files 
of the folders themselves.
